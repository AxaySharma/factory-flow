   git clone https://github.com/AxaySharma/factoryflow.git
   cd factoryflow
   ```
2. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Navigate to the `client` folder** and install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add your MongoDB URI:
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     ```
5. **Run the application**:
   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - **Frontend**:

## üíª Usage

After running both servers:

- Open the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
